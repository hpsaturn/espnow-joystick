## Joystick Implementation

You only need to pass the Joystick message and fill any of the possibilities, for example:

```cpp
EspNowJoystick joystick;
JoystickMessage jm;
bool receiverConnected;

// callback to telemetry values (not mandatory)
class MyTelemetryCallbacks : public EspNowTelemetryCallbacks{
    void onTelemetryMsg(TelemetryMessage tm){
        receiverConnected = tm.e1;
    };
    void onError(const char *msg){
    };
};

void setup() {
    joystick.setTelemetryCallbacks(new MyTelemetryCallbacks());
    jm = joystick.newJoystickMsg();
    joystick.init();
}

void loop() {
    // any implementation, SPI, i2c, analog switchs
    uint8_t ax = map(random(0,100), 0, 100, 0, 200);  
    uint8_t ay = map(random(0,100), 0, 100, 0, 200);
    uint8_t az = map(random(0,100), 0, 100, 0, 200);

    // You are able to fill more variables. See the #proto-definition
    jm.ay = ay;
    jm.ax = ax;
    jm.az = az;

    joystick.sendJoystickMsg(jm);
}
```

## Receiver Implementation

You only need to pass the Telemetry message if you want, and implement the joystick callbacks to receive the parameters for your receiver, it is not mandatory:

```cpp
EspNowJoystick joystick;
TelemetryMessage tm;

// your implementation
void setSpeed(int32_t ax, int32_t ay, int32_t az) {
    Serial.printf("ax:%04i ay:%04i az:%04i\r\n", ax, ay, az);
}

// optional: Send telemetry or status of the receiver
void sendHeartbeat() {
    static uint_least32_t timeStamp = 0;
    if (millis() - timeStamp > 500) {
        timeStamp = millis();
        tm.e1 = true;
        joystick.sendTelemetryMsg(tm);
    }
}

// Joystick data
class MyJoystickCallback : public EspNowJoystickCallbacks {
    void onJoystickMsg(JoystickMessage jm){
        setSpeed(jm.ax, jm.ay, jm.az);
        sendHeartbeat();
    };
    void onError(const char *msg){
        setSpeed(0, 0, 0);
        Serial.println("Error");
    };
};

void setup() {
    joystick.setJoystickCallbacks(new MyJoystickCallback());
    tm = joystick.newTelemetryMsg();
    joystick.init();
}

void loop() {}
```

## P2P Implementation

For send to specific device, you only need to define the address of the device, for example:

```cpp
const uint8_t device1[6] = {0x3C, 0x61, 0x05, 0x0c, 0x93, 0xb8};

void loop() {
    ...
    joystick.sendJoystickMsg(jm,device1); 
}
```

You able to catch the macaddress enabling the debug mode with `joystick.init(true)` on the setup.  

**Note:** in the last version, you don't need specify the mac address of the receiver target. The library can store the mac address detected joystick around, and you are able select it from a simple vector. Please see bellow:

## Multiple receivers handling

The last version is able to generate a device Id vector of the devices detected. With it is possible retrieve its mac address of each one. For example:

```cpp
std::vector<uint32_t> receivers = joystick.getReceivers();
uint32_t deviceId = receivers[0];
const uint8_t macAddress = joystick.getReceiverMacAddr(deviceId);
```

More info in the `m5unified-joystick` example. A little demo of this feature here:

[![ESPNow Joystick multiple receiver demo](https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/423856/282314318-c4a59c87-6d21-4183-ac82-f89c8e1bc470.jpg)](https://youtu.be/FcnYnp4PD0Y)

## Examples

**PlatformIO:**  

For build and upload the examples here, with [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) is more easy, for example from command line you able to upload the M5Stack Joystick firmware, for M5StickC and M5StickCPlus with a simple:

```bash
cd examples/m5unified-joystick/
pio run --target upload
```

or  

```bash
cd examples/mini-tank/
pio run --target upload
```

Also you can make a [DC motors tank](https://github.com/hpsaturn/espnow-joystick/blob/master/examples/robot) or a servo motors [Mini-tank](https://github.com/hpsaturn/mini-tank#readme) or an [Arkanoid Game](https://github.com/hpsaturn/espnow-joystick/blob/master/examples/arkanoid) receiver. See the examples directory.

**Arduino IDE:**

For `Arduino IDE` is a little bit more complicated because the Arduino IDE dependencies resolver is very bad, but you only need first download and install the [Nanopb library](https://github.com/nanopb/nanopb/releases/tag/nanopb-0.4.8) using the `Include Library` section via zip file, and then with the **Library Manager** find **ESPNowJoystick** like this:

or download and install ESPNowJoystick from the [releases section](https://github.com/hpsaturn/espnow-joystick/releases).

**Troubleshooting**:

```cpp
EspNowJoystick.hpp:31:10: fatal error: pb_decode.h: No such file or directory
```

or

Don't forget install first the [Nanopb library](https://github.com/nanopb/nanopb/releases/tag/nanopb-0.4.8)

## Proto Definition

Only for information, **you don't need to do anything here**. This is the current payload [proto definition](https://github.com/hpsaturn/espnow-joystick/blob/master/src/comm.proto) that use the library for default. Thanks to this, you only need to set the messages like the examples, i.e: `jm.bA = 1;` in your code.

In the next version, the idea is maybe pass a custom proto to improve the size or extend the current protocol. The current version only consumes 25 bytes on the Joystick message.
